        The technical director works in a production control room of a television studio and operates 
        the video switcher and associated devices as well as serving as the chief of the television 
        crew. For a remote broadcast outside the studio, the TD will perform the same duties in a 
        mobile production truck. It is the TD's job to ensure all positions are staffed and all 
        equipment and facilities are checked out and ready before the recording session or live 
        broadcast begins. They typically will switch video sources, perform live digital effects and 
        transitions, and insert pre-recorded material, graphics and titles as instructed by the 
        Television director. In larger productions, the director does not actually operate the 
        production equipment, allowing them to coordinate the production and make rapid decisions 
        without worrying about how to mechanically execute the effect or camera move being called for. 
        The technical director may provide training to more inexperienced members of the technical 
        crew when needed. In consultation with the director, the TD may have more or less input into 
        the creative side of the production, depending on the situation. They may provide the 
        director with guidance on crew assignments, camera shots and the most efficient way to 
        accomplish any given effect. The TD is usually responsible for the technical quality of 
        the signal being recorded or broadcast and will use various measuring devices and displays 
        to ensure quality control.
